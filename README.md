Please follow the AWS instructions to use the EKS GPU optimized images.

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/gpu-ami.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/gpu-ami.html)

Primarily, you want to make sure you subscribe to the AMI and then install the NVIDIA device plugin daemon set.

AMIs change quickly, so make sure you have the latest.

See the [eksctl](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl) page for more documentation on the tool.
